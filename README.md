======
This project is an effort to filter tasks for Community for all the Mozilla
WebQA projects hosted on Github i.e fetch all tasks with Community label.

These tasks are really simple to start with and become familiar to the code base
for WebQA.

This project also has a Bugzilla section , which is aimed to fetch all New/Resolved 
tasks one is/was assigned to.

This is particularly helpful to newbies for keeping track of bugs they fixed  
and feel good, since seeing one's Resolved bugs on BMO involves advanced search
which many of them may not be familiar to.
